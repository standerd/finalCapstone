# Project Overview

This is a Booking.com type clone.

It allows for registration of users and for them to search for properties in specific cities.

Users are also able to login via Facebook and Google Oauth rather then registering a new account and logging in.

It also allows for registration of accommodation entities. Entities are able
to register their property, upload images of the property and also manage their accomodation availability.

There is also an admin login functionality for the site admin to login, they can view users, properties and bookings.

The site uses the Google Maps API, it geocodes entity addresses on registration and uses the geocoded co-ordinates to
display properties on a map for the user when searching.

The project ships with 6 x Properties that are set by default. 3 in Johannesburg and 3 in Cape
Town for testing purposes.

All data is store in MongoDB, the Client Side Code is rendered via React App and the Server side is handled by Node.js.

All API keys are secured via a config file and no API keys are contained directly inside and publicaly accessible browser code.

THE APPLICATION CONNECTS TO A DATABASE AND THE GOOGLE MAPS API, THE PROJECT WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT A INTERNET CONNECTION.
